# 9. Create a (4, 4) identity matrix using NumPy and multiply it with a (4, 4) random integer matrix.
# â†’ What do you observe?

# Identity matrix , I = [[1 0 0 0]
#                        [0 1 0 0]
#                        [0 0 1 0]
#                        [0 0 0 1]]

#the result is same as the random integer matrix.
